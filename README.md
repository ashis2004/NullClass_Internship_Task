I’m truly grateful to **NullClass** for the opportunity to be part of their internship program. Over the past few weeks, I’ve worked on meaningful projects like:

1. Fine-tuning a CNN model for age detection using the IMDB-WIKI dataset.
2. Building an Age and Emotion Detection system using voice recognition.
3. Developing a real-time Sign Language Detection app.

This experience helped sharpen my skills in machine learning, deep learning, and full-stack development. Thank you to the NullClass team for the mentorship and support throughout!
